                     CHANGES version 5.9

           This file summarizes changes made since 5.0

Version 5.9


Version 5.8.1

Fixed: Monit XML may be invalid if port check with custom HTTP
protocol request contains ampersand. Thanks to Markus Juenemann
for report.

Fixed: 5.8 added extra socket poll time which showed up as pluss
~ 0.5 sec in M/Monit's port response charts. This release remove
this extra poll time which is not needed.

Fixed: If the process is not running, do not call stop program
during restart (back to Monit 5.6 behavior).

Fixed: Do graceful TCP close for TCP/UDP port test instead of
RST.

Fixed: restart action for non-process service types.

Fixed: FreeBSD jail system memory usage report.

Fixed: Issue #37 crash


Version 5.8

New: Monit no longer purge the environment for sub-processes

New: Add command line option to view Monit ID (-i/--id)

New: Add command line option to reset Monit ID (-r/--resetid)

New: Add client support for using TLS version 1.1 and 1.2. A recent
1.x version of OpenSSL is required and of course that the server
speaks this TLS version. At this time, not many does. Example: 
if failed port 443 with type TCPSSL tlsv11 protocol http  then alert

New: Process UID, EUID and GID tests. Allows to test if the
process is running as a given user. Example:
    check process syslog with pidfile /var/run/rsyslogd.pid
        if failed uid  "syslog" then alert
        if failed euid "syslog" then alert
        if failed gid  "syslog" then alert

New: Add WebSocket protocol test support for port check. Example:
    check host websocket.org with address "echo.websocket.org"
        if failed 
           port 80 protocol websocket
           host "echo.websocket.org"
           request "/"
           origin "http://www.websocket.com"
           version 13
        then alert

New: Simplified HTTP protocol test to allow testing content without 
creating an URL object. It is now possible to say in a more natural way,
 check host mmonit.com with address mmonit.com
       if failed 
          port 80 protocol http
          and request /monit/ with content = "Monit 5.7"
       then alert
meaning that if the page mmonit.com/monit does not contain the text
"Monit 5.7" then the test will fail. To reverse the test, i.e. to test
that the page should not contain a specific string simply use '!=' 
instead, like,
    if failed 
       port 80 protocol http
       with content != "Nagios" 
    then alert
Remember also that the string to test can be a regular expression

New: The HTTP protocol test now support testing the HTTP status code
returned by the server by using "status <operator> <number>".
Backward compatible defaults (return error if status >= 400):
    if failed 
       port 80 protocol http
       and status < 400
    then alert
Return error if a page DOES exist (for success 404 is expected):
    if failed 
       port 80 protocol http
       request "/non/existent.php"
       status = 404
    then alert

Fixed: Unix Socket test now use the communication type (TCP or UDP)
specified in port statement. Previously TCP was always used.

Fixed: Improved test to check if a socket was connected. Since we use
non-blocking connect, we now poll a few ms to avoid "connection failed, 
XXX is not ready for i|o" errors which could occur, especially on high 
latency networks or long distance connect.

Fixed: Simplified if-statements reported in UI

Fixed: Ignore lines starting with '#' in an 'allow htpasswd' file
statement. Thanks to Michael Bakker for reporting the issue

Fixed: Show service restart program on Monit startup in debug mode.
Thanks to Michael Bakker for reporting the issue


Version 5.7

New: Merged https://bitbucket.org/tildeslash/monit/pull-request/1/
from Philippe Kueck:
1) Handle sockets (unix domain) as regular files when checking timestamp.
2) Use mysql 4.1 protocol in MySQL check, required for checking mysql-proxy
3) Skip connection checks during startup timeout.

New: Arguments added to 'check program'. Arguments are whitespace
separated strings. For instance:

  check program list-files with path "/bin/ls -l -r -t /tmp"
        if status != 0 then alert

New: Implemented restart as an optional service action. When Monit
is called to restart a service, it previously called the stop
program registered with the service and then the start program.
Now, if a restart program is registred with the service, this
will be called instead, otherwise Monit fall back to its old
behaviour. Example:
     
  check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
        start   = "/usr/sbin/apachectl start"
        stop    = "/usr/sbin/apachectl stop"
        restart = "/usr/sbin/apachectl restart" <- New

New: Improved communication with M/Monit. Thanks to Hippo Lin. For 
scalability purpose, this Monit version should only be used with
M/Monit version 3.1 or later.


BUGFIXES:


* Monit stopped if an error occurred during MTA connection close.

* Make the Memcache protocol test faster.

* Solaris zone: fix system memory usage report.

* Use chiper list with SSL server instead of relying on default


Version 5.6

IMPROVEMENTS:

* SMTP AUTH LOGIN support added (MS Exchange SMTP authentication
  should now work).

* favicon.ico added to the HTTP interface.

BUGFIXES:

* If an undefined checksum test was used and the file did not exist
  on Monit start, Monit would return an error.

* If the configuration file ended with a comment but with no trailing LF
  character, Monit would return syntax error.

* If a service timed out after too many restarts and alert was used as
  the action, then the Timeout flag remained set even if the service
  recovered.

* SmartOS zone system memory usage report fix.

* Escape mail messages properly for sending via SMTP.

* Escape XML messages properly.

* Compilation: fix the configure script to support default compiler 
  paths when searching for OpenSSL (fixes library search on multi-
  architecture  platforms like Debian and Ubuntu).



Version 5.5.1

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Info and debug messages are no longer sent to stderr, only to stdout.
  Thanks to Sergey Kirpitchev for initial patch.

* Improved output from 'check program', If the program returns an error
  message, include only that message in alert $DESCRIPTION so users can
  compose their own alert format. If program provided no output on
  error, use a default message.

* Improved "check system", $HOST can now be used as a service name.
  $HOST will expand to the system hostname. Example: check system $HOST

BUGFIXES:

* Fixed "Unable to read magic" which was reported on first Monit start.



Version 5.5

IMPROVEMENTS:

* check program:
        - Multiple exit values can be tested within single program check
        - Exit value test supports multiple cycles option ("for X cycles")
        - If exit value test matches and the stderr has no data, try stdout

  Example syntax:
    check program mytest with path "/usr/bin/mytest.sh" with timeout 1000 seconds
       if status == 2 then exec "/usr/local/bin/fix_script.sh"
       if status == 2 for 6 cycles then unmonitor
       if status == 10 then alert

* Renamed mail header (message-id and mime-version) to prevent
  triggering spam check of capitalization. Thanks to Ryan Lee
  for tips.

* The 'check system <name>' statement sets the system hostname in mail
  alerts and initial hostname in M/Monit.

* Increase the default mailserver timeout to 30 seconds.

* Add support for OpenBSD 5.x

BUGFIXES:

* Fix the rare hung on linux which may occur during program execution.
  Thanks to Nick Upson for report.

* In the case that the process start/restart execution failed,
  monit kept "Execution failed" flag even if the process was
  recovered later (for example it was starting slowly or manually
  recovered).

* Fix the mail alert (strict SMTP implementation) to pass
  MTA-side sanity checks like postscreen. Thanks to Len Conrad
  for report.

* The -t option tests the configuration file syntax even if the
  file permissions are wrong. Thanks to Adam Nielsen for report.

* Do not display the default non-existence test for the check
  program (not applicable in the check program context).



Version 5.4

IMPROVEMENTS:

* New process uptime test added. Allows to do some action in
  the case that the process uptime matches the given limit.
  For example to restart the process once per 3 days:
    if uptime > 3 days then restart

* Linux uCLibc support: use internal getloadavg implementation
  in the case that the system libc doesn't implement it.

BUGFIXES:

* The monit hostname will fallback to plain machine's hostname if the
  lookup for FQDN hostname didn't found matching entry. The problem
  was, that based on the order in the /etc/hosts the FQDN lookup
  returned sometimes 'localhost' instead of the FQDN hostname.

* The CPU usage for multi-threaded processes on multi-core machine was
  reported incorrectly in the case that the process used more CPU
  resources then equivalent to one core. Thanks to Tom Pepper for patch.

* The content match test now sends one event per cycle and pattern.
  Even if there are multiple lines matching the same pattern, only
  one event will be generated. Also the event rate is fixed now, so
  it is possible to require match for X cycles before generating the
  event.

* The /proc/ files content match test was skipped, as the file size on
  the procfs is 0, so monit supposed that there is no content to read.

* FreeBSD: If the monitored process had children with multiple threads,
  the total memory usage was reported incorrectly. Thanks to Phil Kulin
  for reporting the problem.

* Allow reading status and perform Monit actions when using client SSL
  certificate. Previously, if Monit http server was setup to use ssl
  and a client cert, status and action failed. Thanks to Markus Linnala
  for initial patch.

* When the process is starting/stopping, do the process state check more
  effectively to not stress the low power devices with aggresive polling.
  Thanks to Thomas Petazzoni for initial patch.

* Make the process start/stop wait resistant to large time changes.

* Compilation: If PAM is enabled but the PAM headers or library are not
  found by the configure script, it will report error.

* Cross-compilation: the configure checks the setjmp and vsnprintf with
  test program which usually cannot be executed when cross-compiling
  for other architecture. The configure script now takes the following
  arguments which allow to specify whether the setjmp works on this
  platform and whether the vsnprintf is C99 compliant. Thanks to
  Thomas Petazzoni for patch.
        ./configure \
                libmonit_cv_setjmp_available=[yes|no] \
                libmonit_cv_vsnprintf_c99_conformant=[yes|no]

* Manual page language fixes. Thanks to Jonathan Boulle for patch.



Version 5.3.2

BUGFIXES:

* Fix bug #34801: The file content match test did reset of the
  read position in the case that the unmonitor or stop action
  was done. When the file monitoring was enabled again, the
  content match test was applied to the content which was
  tested already.

* Log error details in the case that the name resolving failed.

* Fix the system cpu usage statistics when pattern based process
  check is used and the service is restarted. Thanks to Wayne
  Lawrence for report.

* AIX 6.1 compile fix. Thanks to Benedikt Wegmann for patch.

* Debian Bug#652715: "include files not found" warning. Do not
  display the warning if the include directory is empty.



Version 5.3.1

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Log the particular connection attempt failure in debug mode
  when the retry is enabled.

* Monit can deliver events and status to independent M/Monit
  instances if multiple mmonit URLs are set:
      set mmonit https://user1:pass1@mmonit1/collector
                 https://user2:pass2@mmonit2/collector

BUGFIXES:

* The ICMP echo (ping) test may report false positive error
  if the machine where Monit is running has heavy ICMP
  traffic generated by other applications.

* The file content match test will be performed even on the
  existing content when Monit starts. The last position is
  saved to the statefile, so monit won't generate alert
  after restart. Note that when you start the monit 5.3.1
  the first time, it can do actions for content match which
  was handled by previous monit version already as the
  previous monit versions didn't saved the position.

* Make the monitoring state persistent for manual mode services.

* Display the memory usage total % in the status overview.
  The memory usage in kB displayed the total already, so the
  percentage didn't match.

* Fix the HTML overview page alignment in the Internet Explorer.
  Thanks to Darhl Thomason for patch.

* Extend the SSL library search path for Debian Sid.

* Fix Solaris 10 compilation and Sun Studio support.

* Fix sporadic SSL routines:func(169):reason(161) errors

* If MySQL protocol test failed, report the correct MySQL
  error code. Thanks to Vitaly Lipatov for patch.


Version 5.3

* New 'check program' statement added. Allows to check the exit
  status of an external program or script from Monit.

* Added crontab style support for individual services. You can
  now specify when an individual service should run its checks
  (or not run). You can now, for instance, specify that apache
  should be checked continuously, except between 1AM-5AM on
  Sunday.

* Connection retry option added. Allows to retry a network
  connection in the same testing cycle before reporting an error.

* Detailed protocol connection errors are now included in alerts.

* The HTML overview page displays the CPU and memory total now
  (including children), so real service related usage is displayed
  also for services which spawn worker processes, such as Apache
  or Spamassassin.

* HTML view improvements

* Fix MySQL protocol test: MySQL 5.5.12 returns new error code in
  the case of authentication failure.

* Fix Debian bug #621047: monit fails to build after SSLv2 removal

* Fix crash on Solaris which may occur if the system load is zero.
  Thanks to Paul Sun for report.

* The stacktrace logging on error is disabled in -v (verbose) mode
  as it was too verbose for common service debugging tasks, it can
  be enabled using -vv option.

* Improve how fast Monit check if a program was started or stopped.
  Thanks to Michael Renner for patch. 

* Fix the monitoring state presentation during service restart which
  temporarily displayed "Not monitored", whereas the monitoring was
  enabled.

* The "data collected" is updated only if the check was not skipped.


Version 5.2.5

* Fix process match check - when the monitored process failed and
  was restarted by Monit, Monit didn't recognized  it is  running
  after the restart and reported  start failure (similar on stop).
  Thanks to  Kenichi Futatsumori for report and  helping to root
  cause the problem.

* Fix Debian #617259: symbolic links in the filesystem check doesn't
  work.  Thanks to Sergey B Kirpichev for report.

* Fix Debian bug #614984: smtp protocol test issues both EHLO and
  HELO.  Thanks to Sergey B Kirpichev for report.

* Fix bug #32583: Multiple SIP OPTIONS messages use the same header
  data.  Thanks to Hugh Waite for patch.

* Try harder to get FQDN hostname for the host where monit is running.
  The hostname in the $HOST variable which is used in the mail sender
  may thus change. Thanks to Sergey B Kirpichev for patch.

* AIX: Fix the time display which was off by GMT difference. Thanks
  to Helen Chen for report.

* AIX: Fix the M/Monit heartbeat. Thanks to Helen Chen for report.

* Support symbolic link to monit configuration file.

* Fix crash when monit daemon start delay option was used and monit
  was signalized to stop before the start delay passed. Thanks to
  John Schult for report.



Version 5.2.4

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* Added the "procmatch" CLI command which allows for easy testing
  of pattern for process match check. The command takes regular
  expression as an argument and displays all running processes
  matching the pattern. Example usage:
      $ monit procmatch "iChatAgent"

* Set the default log file mask to 0640 (originally it was 0664).
  Thanks to Sergey B Kirpichev.

* Reduced monit memory footprint by ca. 10%.

BUGFIXES:

* FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOSX, Solaris filesystem check fix:
  If block/character device was used in the filesystem path instead
  of mountpoint, monit reported usage of wrong filesystem.

* NetBSD filesystem check: Fix space usage report.

* Fix memory usage monitoring in OpenVZ VPS 2.6.32 virtual hosts.
  Thanks to Kelly for report.

* If the protocol test failed, show the request in the event. Thanks
  to Marco for report.

* Randomize the mail message id to prevent duplicates in the case, that
  the same hostname is used on multiple hosts running monit and messages
  are generated in the same second in parallel. Thanks to Sergey B
  Kirpichev.

* Spelling fixes. Thanks to Sergey B Kirpichev.



Version 5.2.3

BUGFIXES:

* Mysql protocol test supports mysql 5.5.x and newer now.



Version 5.2.2

BUGFIXES:

* Fix crash on MacOSX

* ICMP echo test (ping):
     - bug #31128: do not log error if different response type is received
     - bug #31129: do not require root to use ping test. Privilege to create
       raw socket is still required, but on some platforms such as Solaris it
       can be granted to non-root users too. If the user has no permission to
       perform ping, monit will skip the icmp test and log message (in debug
       mode only).

* rsync protocol test:
     - wait for full server response and verify exit was received
     - bug #31249: send full version to rsync server. Thanks to John Hall
       for report



Version 5.2.1

BUGFIXES:

* HTTP and URL protocol tests: Fixed a problem where HTTP protocol
  tests using a specific request always failed. This bug may also
  affect URL tests. The problem was caused by faulty URL encoding. In
  the process of fixing this bug the new feature that allowed slash in
  service names has been reverted and instead will be added in a later
  release.



Version 5.2

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* Added support for monitoring processes without pidfile using pattern
  matching. You can use POSIX regular expressions or string matching
  process name with arguments as provided by the 'ps' utility. If the
  pattern matches multiple processes, the first match is used.
  Example:
      check process debian 
            matching "/usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx .*deb.vmx"

* Added support for swap monitoring. Example:
      check system myserver
          if swap usage > 25% then alert

* Allow to override the default action when service doesn't exist. The
  default action is restart, it can be customized with following
  statement:
    if [does] not exist [[<x> times within] <y> cycles] then <action1>

* Monit automatically registers credentials with M/Monit now, so it's
  not necessary to set it manually in M/Monit anymore. To disable
  credentials registration:
     set mmonit https://monit:monit@10.0.0.1:8443/collector
         and register without credentials

* Added memcache protocol test. Thanks to Sébastien Debrard for the
  patch.

* Added openssl FIPS to Monit httpd. Thanks to Lior Okman for the
  patch.

* The 'check system' can now use start/stop program statements too.

* Added the option to set the "Reply-To" mail header in mail-format.

* Display backtrace on error if debug mode is enabled (requires
  backtrace support in libc)

BUGFIXES:

* Show real process uptime - formerly the presented uptime was based
  on create and modify timestamp of process' pidfile which provides
  invalid uptime if the pidfile is replaced and process keeps running
  with original PID. Thanks to Nima Chavooshi for report.

* When user triggered action for some service (such as stop) and
  before that action completed user triggered another action for the
  same service (such as start), the second action has been ignored.
  Monit will not accept new action and return temporary error until
  the previous action completed.

* If process resource usage gathering failed, retry next cycle as the
  error can be temporary.

* Fixed sporadic failures when SSL was used.

* ICMP echo test (ping):
     - fixed sporadic false positive/negative
     - removed limit of 20 pings per cycle

* DNS test:
     - accept NS root request refusal as correct response because
       server reacts on request
     - accept authority answer as alternative to record. Thanks to
       Nick Osborn for patch

* RADIUS test fix. Thanks to Alan DeKok for patch.

* M/Monit heartbeat is fully independent of testing cycle now to
  prevent false positive when service test blocks.

* Fixed SMTP STARTTLS protocol, required for servers that adhere
  strictly to RFC 3207 4.2. Thanks to Lorenzo A. Sedano Cadinanos for
  patch.

* Service name:
     - allow the service name to start with "/"
     - fixed handling of the service names which contain "/" in the
       name in Monit web interface. Thanks to Artyom Khafizov for
       patch.
  
* When 'check system' is not defined, monit adds it automatically
  using hostname for service name. If existing service was defined
  with the same service name (matching hostname), monit didn't added
  the entry and reported confusing error message pointing to the end
  of configuration file. Thanks to Thorsten Kampe for report and help.

* Remove extra NL characters from message when resource succeeded
  event is sent. The extra NL character may break the mail headers.
  Thanks to Hanno Boeck for patch.

* Fixed display of cpu user/system/wait usage which temporarily
  displayed -1.0% between two monitoring cycles while cpu monitoring
  was initializing. Thanks to Marcus Muelbuesch for report.

* Fixed display of port response time as -1 if 'monit status' was
  called in the middle of service test.

* Fixed display of service initializing state after monit start or
  reload.

* Fixed MONIT_DESCRIPTION environment variable. Thanks to Marco
  Roeland for patch

* AIX:
     - fixed compilation
     - fixed system load average monitoring
     - fixed ICMP echo test

* Mac OS X:
     - allow monitoring of system-wide load average, cpu and memory
       usage even if
       Monit is running as non-root user

* NetBSD:
     - fixed ICMP echo test



Version 5.1.1

BUGFIXES:

* Fix FTP protocol test. Thanks to Axel Reinhold for report.

* Fix the HTTP protocol test's hostheader option which was added in 5.1.
  Thanks to Naoya Nakazawa for report.

* Removed warning about missing system service check. Missing system service
  check is not error and it shouldn't be reported as such.

* Fix manual page formating. Thanks to Stefan Alfredsson for report.



Version 5.1

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* It is now possible to define any action for the restart timeout rule.
  Multiple restart timeout rules can also be defined. Example:
      if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then exec "/foo/bar"
      if 8 restarts within 10 cycles then unmonitor

* Service can be added to multiple groups. Thanks to Brad Gessler
  for suggestion. Syntax:
    check filesystem wwwdata with path /www
      group www
      group filesystem

* Added GPS protocol test. Thanks to Sebastien Debrard for patch.

* Added RADIUS protocol test. Thanks to Alan DeKok for patch. Example syntax:
    check process radiusd with pidfile /var/run/radiusd.pid
       start program = "/etc/init.d/freeradius start"
       stop program = "/etc/init.d/freeradius stop"
       if failed 
          host 127.0.0.1 port 2000 type udp protocol radius secret testing1234 
       then alert
       if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout

* The HTTP protocol test now supports a hostheader option which allows to
  override Host header in HTTP request. It can be used for example
  to test a farm of HTTP servers by IP addresses and to set specific
  Host header. Thanks to Brady Catherman for patch. Example:
    if failed host 192.168.1.100 protocol http hostheader "example.com" then alert

* If an error occur during Monit command-line execution, report the error
  and exit with 1, so it is possible to react if Monit is used from a script.
  On success, 0 is returned as usual. Previously, Monit always exited with
  0 even if an error occurred.

* Do not require SSL version type when specifying SSL communication with M/Monit
  (SSL version is set to auto).

* If the Monit http interface failed to start, provide more details about
  the reason.

BUGFIXES:

* Support resource monitoring (cpu usage, etc.) when Monit is running
  inside virtual environment. Tested on:
      - FreeBSD jail
      - Solaris zone
      - Linux Vserver

* Fix #26752: inside Solaris Zone, Monit failed to detect children
  and computed host memory wrong

* On Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, Monit no longer needs to run as root user
  in order to be able to watch process resource usage (cpu and memory).

* Send heartbeat to M/Monit even if Monit is busy in a long testing cycle to prevent
  false alerts about non-responsive Monit agent.

* Fixed SMTP protocol test which may sometimes incorrectly
  report ESMTP protocol failure. Thanks to Axel Reinhold for
  report.

* Fixed content match check which reported only first
  match during the same cycle. Thanks to Pavel Shevaev for
  report.
  
* Allow for the use of complete SSL certificate chains. 
  Thanks to Lawrence Tan for patch.

* Added support for multiline greetings to FTP protocol test.
  Thanks to Giovanni D'Cristina for report.

* Fix Debian Bug #541139: uses gethostbyname() and thus does
  not work with "options inet6" in /etc/resolv.conf. Thanks to
  Michael Stapelberg for patch.

* If Monit configuration allowed http interface access for a read-only
  user and it was specified as the first allow entry, Monit command line
  commands failed because it used the read-only account so commands
  like start, stop, etc. were rejected. Monit will now use full access
  regardless of allow option order. Thanks to Thorsten Kampe for report.

* Passive monitoring mode fixed. Thanks to Nelson Vale for report.

* Fixed #27784: wait_start/wait_stop can advance too quickly.
  Thanks to Randy Puro for report.

* Solaris resource usage fixed when Monit was compiled with optimizations enabled.

* Fixed #28369: escape XML properly

* Check service name uniqueness when 'check system' is missing in monitrc and virtual
  system service with name set to local hostname is added. Thanks to Marcus Muelbuesch
  for report.

* Fix crash when queued event delivery was retried for service which was no longer
  configured in Monit.



Version 5.0.3

BUGFIXES:

* Fixed #26664: crash on service timeout or unmonitor action
  (introduced in 5.0.2). Thanks to Bretislav Kubesa and
  Michael Shigorin for report.

* Removed the configure --without-resource option. If the user
  who is running Monit doesn't have permissions to check the
  processes state, the related checks are disabled dynamically. 



Version 5.0.2

BUGFIXES:

* 35 improvements based on code scan with Klocwork
  (http://www.klocwork.com/) which we were evaluating.
  Huge thanks to Klocwork for their great product.

* Fixed #26382: if start or stop script for some service didn't
  exist, monit logged error during configuration file parsing and
  refused to start. Monit now just logs warning and continues.



Version 5.0.1

BUGFIXES:

* Fixed a bug where Monit did not stop logging succeeded events.
  This bug occurred if PID, PPID, timestamp or size change tests
  were used and failed and then succeeded again.



Version 5.0

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* M/Monit support added. If you run Monit on more than one
  server, you can use M/Monit to manage and control all your
  Monit enabled servers from one simple Web Interface. See
  http://mmonit.com/ for details.

* Support use of symbolic links in filesystem check. Thanks to
  Aleksander Kamenik for suggestion. Example:
    check filesystem rootfs path 
         /dev/disk/by-uuid/4ef973f7-67d1-4bb0-8223-cb1c692b72e4
      if space usage > 95% then alert
      if inode usage > 95% then alert

* If no 'set mailserver' was defined in monitrc, Monit tried to
  fallback to localhost:25 SMTP server. This fallback was removed
  since it may be confusing. If you want to deliver mail alerts
  from Monit, the 'set mailserver' option is necessary. In case
  it is missing, Monit will log appropriate error and hint to add
  it.

* The generic send/expect protocol test limited the expect input
  to 256 bytes. It's possible to set the input buffer for expect
  globally - for example: set expectbuffer 20 kb Thanks to Asil
  Carlin for suggestion.

* The following event types were added CONTENT, FSFLAGS, PID and
  PPID and the following generic event types CHANGED and MATCH were
  removed and replaced by the above types and with the existing SIZE,
  CHECKSUM, TIMESTAMP events so the information is more specific
  The event types are internal to Monit and unless you have used
  either CHANGED or MATCH event in your alert filters, no change
  is necessary (alerts are delivered as usual, the tests just use
  different types internally).
  
* Monit now generates a unique id on first start and store the id
  in a permanent file. This id is used in protocol communication
  between Monit and M/Monit to pair a Monit instance with it's
  host entry in M/Monit. By default the id file is placed in
  $HOME/.monit.id. The location can be changed by using the set
  idfile statement, for example:
    set idfile /var/monit.id

* Monit now keep its service monitoring state even on Monit
  restart. Previously Monit dropped the state when it was stopped
  correctly. Services in manual monitoring mode will remember the
  monitoring state across Monit restarts. If Monit is used in a
  cluster, it is recommended to place the state file in a
  temporary filesystem incase the primary machine will crash and
  the the spare machine takeover, the state will be dropped on
  reboot for the crashed machine and the services in manual
  monitoring mode won't be started on reboot. For example the
  "set statefile /tmp/monit.state" can be used to place the state
  file in the /tmp/ filesystem.

* Added a protocol test for testing the LMTP protocol. Thanks
  to Fco. Javier Felix for patch.

* Added the start delay option for daemon statement which allows
  to pause Monit on its startup for a while. If monitored
  services are started by init scripts in parallel on system
  boot, Monit may be too fast and detect that the service is not
  running (yet) and restart the service. Note that it's still
  recommended Monit is setup to be responsible for service
  startup (that is, don't use init to start Monit controlled
  services, instead use Monit). This will ensure correct startup
  without need for a start delay since Monit will have full
  control of service startup. Many users start services from init
  on boot anyway, so in such cases this option will solve their
  problems. Default start delay is 0 which corresponds to the
  current behavior. Example syntax which will make Monit wait one
  minute before starting its first monitoring cycle:
  --8<--
    set daemon 5 with start delay 60
  --8<--
  Thanks to Fco. Javier Felix for patch.

* Added PAM support for Monit http interface authentication. Note
  that PAM is not supported on all platforms - currently works on
  Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD. Monit uses the PAM service "monit".
  Here is a Monit PAM service example for Mac OS X which is able
  to authenticate system users for Monit access -
  /etc/pam.d/monit:
  --8<--
    # monit: auth account password session
    auth       sufficient     pam_securityserver.so
    auth       sufficient     pam_unix.so
    auth       required       pam_deny.so
    account    required       pam_permit.so
  --8<--
  And configuration for monitrc which allows only group admins
  to access the http interface:
  --8<--
    set httpd port 2812 allow @admin
  --8<--
  See the PAM manual page for details on how to configure the PAM
  service on your system and the available PAM plugins. Thanks to
  Wilhelm Meier for patch.

* Added more detailed reports for Monit resource tests on service
  recovery. Thanks to Lars Kotthoff for patch.

* Set locale to C.

* Added a protocol test for testing the SIP protocol which is
  used by popular communication servers such as Asterisk and
  FreeSWITCH. We received two patches for this protocol and have
  taken code from both and merged them. Many thanks to Bret 
  McDanel and to Pierrick Grasland for supplying the patches.

* Added MONIT_DESCRIPTION to the list of environment variables
  available to programs started by monit. Thanks to Morten 
  Bressendorff Schmidt for patch.

* If a service group is specified for Monit CLI action,
  Monit no longer requires the "all" verb, so the following
  command is possible:
    monit -g web stop
  If group is not specified (i.e. the -g option is omitted), the
  service name or "all" is still required as a safeguard.

* Added an option to the 'set mailserver' statement so it is
  possible to override the hostname used in SMTP EHLO/HELO and in
  the Message-ID header when sending mail. Monit defaults to use
  the localhost name. I.e. what you get when executing this
  command 'uname -n'. Overriding the host name can be useful if
  the host does not have a DNS entry and if the receiving
  mailserver uses DNS verification as spam protection. The new
  override option is:
  set mailserver foo.bar.baz using hostname "my.monit.host"

* A new Event_Action type was added which reports actions
  performed on Monit's administrator request (either via web
  interface or CLI). If you don't want to received these events,
  you can set the mail-filter for "action" event type.

* NOTA BENE: Monit start action is synchronous now. This improves
  the startup sequence for dependent services, since Monit will
  wait for parent service to start before trying to start the
  child.

* It is now possible to define execution timeout for start and
  stop commands. That is, how long Monit will wait after
  executing a command before it assume execution failed. If the
  timeout option is omitted, Monit defaults to 30 seconds. You
  can override the timeout for example for services which are
  starting slower.
  Example syntax:
    start program = "/bin/foo start" with timeout 60 seconds

* The event passed state is renamed to succeeded as this name
  more reflects the state of things.

* The device service test is renamed to filesystem.

BUGFIXES:

* Some linux virtualization platforms report CPU count as 0.
  Monit then dynamically disabled CPU usage monitoring. In such
  case we now override the CPU count from 0 to 1 so resource
  usage monitoring can continue. Thanks to Jenny Hopkins for
  report.

* Increased the server socket backlog queue which will make Monit
  able to handle more services. Thanks to Jochen Kramer.

* Fixed #24866: Email messages such as: cpu wait usage check
  succeeded [current cpu wait usage=17.4%] were displayed as
  "...usage<SOMEGARBAGE>.4%". The problem was incorrect transfer
  encoding header in the email (the body itself was OK). Thanks
  to Dave Cheney for report.

* When a Monit shutdown requested was issued while Monit were
  working and testing services, Monit did not shutdown until all
  work were done, i.e. until all services were tested. Monit will
  now shutdown faster - as soon as it finish testing the current
  service.

* Monit blocked/unblocked SIGTERM, SIGINT SIGHUP and SIGUSR1
  signals during operation to protect certain code sections. When
  a signal was sent during such a time, for example to stop
  Monit, it was dropped and had to be retried in order to stop
  Monit. This limitation is now removed and signals will be
  processed at any time. Thanks to Nicola Tiling for report.

* If the Monit httpd allow option did not include a
  user:password, Monit CLI logged the following error (even if
  the action was performed anyway):
     Cleartext credentials needed for basic authorization!
  This error was false - even access restriction based on
  host/net is sufficient - user and password is just one of
  possible options (not requirement). Thanks to Gilad Benjamini
  for report.

* Allow localhost as a value for the host header in the http
  protocol test instead of setting an empty host header and let
  the http server decide

* The 'if changed checksum ...' test can now be used even if a
  monitored file doesn't exist at Monit startup. Thanks to Joe
  Shang for report.

* If both event handlers (M/Monit and mail alerts) temporarily
  failed at once and event queue was enabled, events will be
  stored in the queue and delivered in the next cycle. However, a
  bug caused delivery to be retried for every cycle for both
  handlers if just one of them was recovered. Monit could then
  deliver the same message multiple times until both handlers
  recovered. The problem is now fixed and only one copy of the
  event is sent even if only one handler did recover.

* Make unit in size test optional and default to byte unless
  specified. So it is possible to write, if size > 1000 then ..

* Fixed handling of invalid input files in event queue handler.
  Thanks to Fco.Javier Felix for patch.

* Set the content type to text/html for Monit web interface POST
  responses. Thanks to Rich Drummond for patch.

* Fixed #23530: configure script will return error if bison,
  byacc or yacc are not found at Monit compile time.

* Fix CPU and memory monitoring on Solaris (it was disabled on
  Monit start)

* AIX fixes and extensions, Monit should run on AIX without
  problems, including cpu, memory and filesystem monitoring
  (tested with AIX 5.3). Thanks to Brian Downey for support
  and help.

* HP-UX fixes and extensions, Monit should run on HP-UX without
  problems, including cpu, memory and filesystem monitoring.
  Thanks to Brian Downey for support and help.

* Fixed #23467: Don't exit, only issue a warning if the "include"
  statement did not find any files to include.

* Fixed #23530: Event queue did not work with the default
  unlimited slots.

* Fixed #23617: The process cpu usage is initializing in the
  first cycle so the value is set to 0% - if the 'cpu usage <
  xyz%' test was used to check that the process usage is higher
  then given level, it was always true. Monit now skips the
  process cpu usage check in the first cycle.

* Make sure Monit alerts has a unique message id. Thanks to Steve
  Purcell for report

* Fixed possible crash when Monit is watching VPS environment on
  Linux which reports number of CPUs as 0. Thanks to Marius
  Schmidt for report.

* Cleanup event states during a service stop/unmonitor so old 
  events are not sent when the service is started/monitored again.

* Fixed #21989: Monit could start two instances of the process
  when service restart is performed and the process is starting
  slowly. Thanks to Nick Upson, Aaron Scamehorn and David Greaves
  for report.

* Fixed #21550: Fix crash when Monit event queue contained an
  empty file. Thanks to Douglas J Hunley for report.

* Fixed possible crash when the 'if changed checksum' test was
  used along with restart action. Thanks to Brian Candler for
  report.

* Fixed #22075: Allow using a mail address as username when using
  SMTP authentication.

* Fixed #22191 and #19823: If the file content test does not match
  anymore, reset the service error state. (Previous versions did 
  not clear the error state and kept showing a match in the status
  listing and in the http interface).

* The 'if changed size ...' test can now be used even if the
  monitored file does not exist on monit's start.

* If a htpasswd file is used to control Monit http interface
  access and the hash type is set to MD5 but the file contains
  wrong format (non-MD5), report the error and keep running.
  Formerly Monit exited with an assert exception. Thanks to
  Adrian Bridgett for report.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

* The current CPU usage test which checked the cpu usage of the
  process itself plus the cpu usage of child processes was
  renamed to TOTALCPU (otherwise it works the same). The new CPU
  usage test checks the CPU usage of the process itself only.
  This change was introduced to align the syntax with MEMORY and
  TOTALMEMORY tests and to allow to test the CPU usage of
  processes which fork child processes but the user don't want to
  include children (such as Mythtv). Users who are using the CPU
  check for services like Apache webserver to watch total cpu
  utilization (including children) should rename the CPU
  statement in their configuration to TOTALCPU.
